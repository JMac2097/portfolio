<br>



After hours of decision-making and trying to think of
a good idea for my final ECA project, I settled on making up a website
for a fictional night club called Unified. <br>



Then I had to think about what the site would be used for. &nbsp;I
managed to do a fair bit of research into this, I collected samples
from quite a few real nightclub websites,&nbsp; most were
ghastly, and from this collection I concluded what the average user would expect to find on a nightclub homepage.<br>



I&nbsp; identified that the main purpose of the site would be to
advertise, not only the club, but also the events that would be
happening at the club. &nbsp;So it would be a
balance between commercial (making money from ticket sales) and
Informative (keeping the user up to date with upcoming events). I
decided that the club would also include live bands to make it more
varied and to allow me to put more information into my site. &nbsp;The
main user group that I was aiming it at were the 21 year olds to 31
year olds age group (older people are welcome too) and I
wanted to get away from that whole "larging it" feel that most
nightclub sites seem to promote and go with something a little fresh
and different.<br>



I set out that these users would be looking for an exciting venue to
spend an evening in, they would also be looking for variety, so I tried
to represent many different musical genres and tastes on the site by
having many different genre-based club nights. So, in the end, I
decided that the keyword for the construction of my site would be
"exciting". <br>

To achieve this feel of excitement, I included a few large images
of&nbsp; dancers, djs playing music, and a live band, these were all
quite exciting looking "action" images which I managed to get hold of
thanks to Flickr (</span></font><font style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" size="-1"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/">http://www.flickr.com</a>
accessed 17 June 2008) and I displayed one main image per page to keep
the site neat-looking and to tie-in with the information that was
displayed on the relative pages.<br>



While designing my site, I came up with a few ideas to add extra levels
of interaction. &nbsp;Having not long before read about
interaction in Lesson 9, the idea appealed to me.<br>

The first would be an online order form which I created a link to on
the bookings page, but of course, the form doesn't actually exist.
&nbsp;I put a
notice on the site to say that the link is currently out of action, but
this form would be along similar lines as the type you can find on
on-line shopping sites, where you have to enter card details and
quantities of tickets etc..<br>



Another feature that I would include would be a music sampler.
&nbsp;This would allow the user to click on the band that they were
interested in seeing live and they would not only be presented with a
form containing more details about the band, there would also be an
online music player to allow the user to sample snippets of tracks from
the band, or even a media player that would play video clips. Obviously
coding something like that would be way above my level at this time but
it would simply involve the use of an appropriate plug-in, eg Shockwave.<br>



The final idea that I would incorporate would be a bulletin board where
the user could post comments about the events they were excited about
seeing or the events that they'd enjoyed being at, or even post up a
review of one of the bands. &nbsp;This feature would be very useful and
get the users talking amongst themselves, and they could even arrange
to meet up. &nbsp;Taking the interactive element even further.<br>

Site design, ease of navigation and accessibility<br>



</span><font size="-1"><br>



<br>


I followed the guidelines for the structure of my site that I was shown
in Lesson 7 session 2. &nbsp;Although the project site is relatively
small, I decided that the best option would be to make the site
web-like, so every page could be reached from every other page, laying
out the design of the site in a web-like structure. &nbsp;If the site
was any larger, then I could have considered using a hierarchical
structure, starting with the index page and moving down from there.<br>


Simplicity was a word that I kept in my mind, I wanted this site to be
both visually appealing, but at the same time incredibly simple and
usable, the user should just log in, find what they want, and go from
there,</font></font><font style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><font size="-1">
which is where accessibility becomes a factor. &nbsp;I had to design a
site that allows the user
to adjust the text size and all images have to contain alternative text
in case a user is utilising a device, such as a screen reader.</font></font><br>


<font style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><font size="-1">
Working on a separate piece of paper, I set out what information each
of the pages would contain. &nbsp;I managed to break it down into five
groups for each of the five pages that were required in the design
brief, also including the Index and report page.<br>

The page titles I settled on were: Gig guide, Club nights, Bookings,
Location and finally, About us. &nbsp;The Index page contains a brief
run down of what the site contains, including hyperlinks to the other
pages as well as the primary navigation. &nbsp;The Gig guide, I
decided, would primarily be a table containing information about live
bands that were playing. &nbsp;The Club nights page would be similar to
the previous Gig guide, because the information it needs to display is
similar too. &nbsp;The Bookings page contains information about ticket
booking, but as I've already said in the first section, the link to the
online form doesn't work, so I decided to put up &nbsp;a warning on
screen to say the the link was currently under maintenance. &nbsp;The
Location page would contain a map of the area and the club's made up
address (that information is also displayed in the main header on
each page). &nbsp;Finally, the About us page, put in for the user to
contact the club. &nbsp;This page could also be the home of the
bulletin board that I mentioned previously.<br>


Navigation was a main concern for me, having again read through Lesson
7 &nbsp;session 3, I had to ensure that my navigation answers the key
user questions:<br>


Where am I? Where have I been? Where can I go next? How do I return to where I started?<br>

I decided to make my navigation a simple
horizontal bar across the top of &nbsp;the page under the main header,
putting it in the centre and at the top which is where the user looks
for important information, according to Joel Sklar's screen map, which
was mentioned in Lesson 2. Each page is also clearly headed and
highlighted when displayed on screen in the navigation bar. &nbsp;The
user can also travel anywhere they like using this navigation,
obviously it may need to be restricted once the site gets bigger to
stop users getting lost.<br>


This literally being a one man operation, the only testing that I could
invoke was to upload my pages using Firefox and view them on-screen to
see how the design was progressing. &nbsp;This however does have
disadvantages. &nbsp;The page can sometimes look radically different in
the NVU work window than it does in the actual browser window. <br>


Not having a client or an actual user base to feed back ideas and
concepts to is also restrictive, because even though I feel that I have
met the design brief quite well, &nbsp;I know this having opened up my
final site and taken a User trip around it, who's to say that the
client I would be designing for would agree with me, or even the users?
&nbsp;So in a real design environment, I would be feeding ideas to the
client, and when we had found an idea that worked, then some proper
user testing could be carried out.<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;<br>


</font></font><font style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Page design, layout, use of fonts, use of images, use of colour<br>



</font><font style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><font size="-1"><br>



<br>


When I finally got down to the serious work of putting the design on
screen, I loaded up NVU, and had a bit of a play around with tables and
such, realising that the use of tables pretty much allowed me to place
whatever I liked wherever I liked on the page. &nbsp;This brief period
of experimenting was quite valuable, because it got me back into the
feel of NVU and all its little quirks (freezing when you have lots of
work on the screen for one). &nbsp;<br>


After experimentation, I then proceeded to start mocking up pencil versions of what the main
index page would look like, I came up with six rough layouts which I
had designed keeping in mind the design information that I learned way
back in lesson 2, which was Robin Williams' acronym PARC: Proximity,
Alignment, Repetition and Contrast. I also tried to keep in mind Joel
Sklar's screen map, which detailed the levels of importance of elements
on the screen, which I also learned about in lesson 2. &nbsp;Keeping these two factors in mind, I drew up a rough design that
complied with both. All relevant areas were grouped together, all the
important information was in the centre and at the top of the page, navigation and header, and
I decided to make the page design in such a way so that it could be repeated
throughout the website. <br>


Working on a very rough looking, monochromatic page isn't very
appealing, the urge to add colour was overwhelming. &nbsp;I&nbsp; resisted, as my low score on the colour deficiency test from
lesson 4 revealed, colour isn't my strong point, but I can use this
information to my advantage when designing a webpage so other users
like myself aren't left out. &nbsp;But before that, I had to get the
layout perfect on NVU, and I also wanted each page to flow into the
next, so that the design theme followed through and conformed to the
Repetition rule from the PARC acronym. &nbsp;When going from page to
page, I have set the site out so that the only elements that change are
the text blocks and some of the content, all of the headings and
navigation remain in the same areas, at the same sizes. &nbsp;All of
the tables on the site are measured by screen percentage rather than
being locked down to pixel size, this allows the site to be view in
pretty much any size of browser screen and allowing for more
acccessability.<br>


When deciding on an appropriate font, I wanted something that would
look neat and tidy at all font sizes, so it had to be a sans-serif
font, as serifs do look a bit rough on a small sized font, I settled on
verdana as it is a very pleasing to look at and I am comfortable with
using it. &nbsp;For the sake of accessibility, all font sizes are
adjustable, but the default for page text is small, as verdana tends to
look better the smaller it gets.<br>


Images had to also be incorporated into the final design, I managed to
get hold of quite a few relevant images by doing a search on Flickr (</font></font><font style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" size="-1"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/">http://www.flickr.com</a>
accessed 17 June 2008). &nbsp;I decided to use small jpg files, because
of the limit of 50kb per image and 100kb limit for a page. &nbsp;The
images that I chose were then loaded into Irfanview</font><font size="-1"><a href="http://www.irfanview.com/"> (<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">http://www.irfanview.com</span></a></font><font style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" size="-1">)
and then re-saved as much smaller sized files, the image quality hasn't
decreased noticeably either. &nbsp;As some of the images that I had
originally downloaded were grey-scaled, I decided that it would be
interesting to see what would happen if all the sites images follow
suit. &nbsp;This worked very well as it adds contrast to the image and
the coloured surroundings.<br>


I had tried out many colour schemes, but the one which worked the best
was based around different saturations of blue, a deep blue for the
background and a lighter, less saturated blue for the main content boxes, The club logo
uses the font Engravers MT and is a saturated yellow in direct contrast
with the blue that surrounds it. &nbsp;This effect draws the eye up to the company logo and contact details. &nbsp;<br>

So, in conclusion, I am quite pleased with my final site, and I hope
that I have met the design brief to a high standard. &nbsp;I enjoy web
design greatly, and I have learned a lot from this course, and I hope
to study further into this design field.<br>
